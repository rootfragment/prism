# Learning Progress

This folder documents the learning journey and experimental steps taken during the development of **PRISM**, a high-performance rainbow table calculator.
It includes notes, experiments, small scripts, benchmarks, and insights gained while exploring password security, hash precomputation, and optimization techniques.

The purpose of this folder is to track progress, highlight lessons learned, and serve as a reference for future improvements. Contributions to experiments or documented learnings are welcome.
